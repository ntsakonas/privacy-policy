## MUF Predictor privacy policy

Thanks for downloading and using the MUF Predictor app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Nick Tsakonas. This is not an open source app; the app is only available on Google Play. 
I am not making the app available on any other store or APK download sites. The only safe way to get the app is Google Play.

The app does not have and will never have any ads.
The app does not sell products or services neither in the form of in-app products or via external stes and will never ask you to pay for anything.

I take privacy very seriously and therefore the app does not and will never collect any personal data including but not limited to name, age, sex, account information, login information, passwords,  
location, device information, network information, financial info, credit cards, purhcase history, messages, contacts, browsing activity, browsing history, installed applications, application activity.

The only permission required by the app is network access. This does not allow the app to access any information stored on your phone.

The app does not access your saved files or photos - it does not need them. It only uses its own private storage allocated by the OS to save 
its database when you use the "saved locations" feature and access its own files and settings. 

The app uses the network connection to download updated solar data only (when required). It does not download anything else. 

The application only uses Google Analytics to gather statistics about the most used features in the app so that I know when I can improve or remove features.
The application also uses Google Crashlytics to report crashes when they occur in the app. No personal data are captured in the ceash reports. 
This version, being quite old, did not implement the option to opt-out both from Google Analytics and Crashlytics. 
Both Google Analytics and Crahslytics are (obviously) Google products and the data is not exported or shared with any 3rd party. 
The data stays in Google's systems as they intended to, and viewed in Google's dashboard only, and only by me for analysis and monitoring purposes.

To the best of my knowledge the app has no security vulnerabilities that can put your personal data at risk. 
If you have any concerns please uninstall the app immediately and let me know.
